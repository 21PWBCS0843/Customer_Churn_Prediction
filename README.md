- Explore customer risk distribution
- Analyze feature importance rankings
- Monitor churn trends across segments

## üìà Model Performance

| Metric | Individual Models | Ensemble |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 82.3% | - |
| Random Forest | 84.7% | - |
| Gradient Boosting | 86.1% | - |
| **Final Ensemble** | - | **86.5%** |

## üé® Features in Detail

### Advanced Feature Engineering
- **Ratio-based Features**: Balance-to-Salary, Credit-to-Salary ratios
- **Behavioral Indicators**: Products-per-tenure, activity flags
- **Interaction Features**: Young inactive customers, multiple product holders

### Customer Segmentation
The system identifies four distinct customer segments:
- **Young Professionals**: Early career customers with growth potential
- **Established Savers**: Stable, long-term customers with high balances
- **High-Value Clients**: Premium customers requiring specialized retention
- **At-Risk Seniors**: Older customers with higher churn probability

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Missing value imputation (median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Outlier detection using IQR method with capping (not removal)
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Feature scaling and normalization
